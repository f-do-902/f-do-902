### Hi there 

I've created this account mainly in order to [@GermanZero-de](https://github.com/GermanZero-de) and maybe to manage some private 
projects of mine here. 

In professional life, I am a JEE (EJB and JSF) and COBOL (mainframe and [Micro Focus](https://github.com/MicroFocus) Visual COBOL) 
developer for a car insurance company. 

In my spare time, from time to time I improve my privately used Android to Chromecast Audio streaming app, or I try to help 
[@GermanZero-de](https://github.com/GermanZero-de) as a volunteer with their website or wherever IT skills are needed, as I am 
deeply convinced that there is no bigger challenge than the climate crisis in our days.
